Building My Primary Care CLI Gem (Ruby)


1. Plan your gem and imagine what the interface will look like
2. Start with the project structure
3. Start with the entry point or the file run
4. Use that to build the CLI interface
5. Stub out the interface
6. Start making things real by using real site data
7. Discover objects
8. Program


This gem's purpose is to be able to take in a zip code in DC, and give you the closest Primary Care Providers to it.


The user should type in "an-apple-a-day"
Should get back a list of Primary Care providers

Will use Recording Tool - simplescreenrecorder

***Update. I needed to pivot. So as opposed to looking up centers by zip code, we can try to look up Hospitals by their respective wards in DC.***
The original site was a bit challenging (coded in js) so I moved to a better site with actual HTML. I later learned that with http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/018890d7399245759f05c7932261ef44_7?geometry=-77.469%2C38.811%2C-76.546%2C38.971&orderByFields=PrimaryCarePt.OBJECTID+ASC&uiTab=table&filterByExtent=true
I could use a JSON API with specific calls. I can revisit this site again later.
For now I'd like to continue to use the nokogiri approach and scrape from the HTML site found here: http://doh.dc.gov/node/173192

1st level could be depending on ward you'll get health care providers in there. A level deeper would be a list of ones closest to your zip code?

***Update. Instead of presenting a list. Why not ask for which ward they're looking for and presenting hospitals at that point?
***Another thing I overlooked is that there isn't a hospital for every ward of DC though most are covered. Typing in your ward may not print out a result.
